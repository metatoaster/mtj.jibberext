Introduction
============

A set of Commands that extend off the `mtj.jibber`_ bot module that
provide more extensive functionality that at the very least serves as
examples on how to potentially develop off that core, but also to
provide a diverse set of usable plugins that can be plugged into a bot.

Useful modules requiring somewhat extensive depenencies that are used
with mtj.jibber are included here.  Currently we have:

- A fortunes package
- A pinger package
- An imgur image picker
- A QR code generator (using Unicode symbols).
- Assorted untilities.

Further documentation to come for each of the above, but some classes
are documented at the source code level, with example configurations
that can be copied into a mtj.jibber configuration file.
